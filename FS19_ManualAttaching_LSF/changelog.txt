FS19 - Manual Attaching

v1.1
Fixed following errors:
-line 58: when you start new game as farm manager or start from scratch
-line 438: when detaching PTO from trailer with PTO function
-line 250: when start tipping with trailer with PTO function and no PTO attached
-line 271: when attaching two conveyor belt (or any with driveable spec)
-line 491: when detaching implement from attacherVehicle with no MA spec.

With this mod you need to get out of the vehicle to attach or detach implement / trailer.
-drive vehicle to implement, get out and move to attacherjoint
-you will see attaching markers
-you also need to manually attach PTO.
-you need to detach PTO first before detach implement
-you can switch between 3 mods of attaching (Manually only, Inside vehicle only and Both Manually / Insid)
-if PTO is not connected, implement cant be turned on / start tipping
-you can show / hide current MA mode in F1 help menu

Controls:
Attach / detach implement - "KEY_q"
Attach / detach PTO - "KEY_x"
Toglle mode - "KEY_lshift KEY_a"
Show / hide mode in help menu - "KEY_lctrl KEY_a"
